# iamrich

This is taking the idea of an old app store application and redoing it in Flutter. 

## I Am Rich History
Here is a link to the wikipedia that talks about the app.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_Rich)
All this application did was turn on and show a red gem in the center. That's it. This app was sold 
for $999.99, which was the most that you could sell an app at the time. This app does exactly the 
same thing except that it shows a diamond. 

## The App Brewery
This application is part of The App Brewery course on Udemy.com
[Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/?referralCode=2B7724A180C0502A2547)

## Getting Started
To run this application you will need to setup the environment.
[Flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) has simple and easy to follow tutorial
on how to get the environment ready. 
Clone the repo to whatever folder you want and open it up in the IDE you most like. 
You might need to download some extensions/plugins. (Flutter and Dart)

## Learning
Spend some time changing things. Change the color or change the image. Whatever you do, enjoy it.
